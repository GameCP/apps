# Admin Notes

**Private, collaborative documentation for your game server staff.**

Stop using disparate Google Docs or sticky notes to track server issues. Admin Notes puts a dedicated, private notebook right inside your game server dashboard. Perfect for tracking player bans, configuration quirks, maintenance logs, or handing off information between shifts.
