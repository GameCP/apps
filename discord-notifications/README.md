## Why you need this

*   **Never miss a crash:** Get instant alerts if a server goes down so you can fix it immediately.
*   **Keep players informed:** Automatically notify your community when servers restart or update.
*   **Monitor activity:** Track server performance and lifecycle events without leaving Discord.

## Key Features

*   🔔 **Real-time Status Alerts:** Instant notifications for server starts, stops, and restarts.
*   💥 **Crash Detection:** Immediate alerts when a server process terminates unexpectedly.
*   🎨 **Customizable Messages:** Configure which events trigger notifications to avoid spam.
*   🔧 **Easy Setup:** Just paste your Discord Webhook URL and you're ready to go.

## How it works

Once installed, simply navigate to your game server's extension tab, paste in your Discord Webhook URL, and select the events you want to subscribe to. The extension handles the rest, running silently in the background to monitor your server status.
