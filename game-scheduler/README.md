## Key Features

*   📅 **Visual Schedule Builder:** Intuitive interface for creating complex schedules (e.g., "Every Friday at 5 PM").
*   🔄 **Automated Restarts:** Schedule routine restarts to maintain server performance.
*   ⏹️ **Scheduled Stops:** Automatically stop servers during off-peak hours to save resources.

## How it works
